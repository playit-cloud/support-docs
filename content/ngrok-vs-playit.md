Ngrok is a tool commonly used to make local servers, including Minecraft servers, accessible over the internet. It works by creating a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to your local machine, which means you don’t need to configure your router or deal with port forwarding.  

Playit.gg is a similar tool, primarily designed for hosting Minecraft servers. Ngrok is more general-purpose and targeted at developers who need to expose websites or applications in development, but it can also be used for game servers.  

Some differences between the two:  

- **Bandwidth:** Ngrok’s free plan has a limit of 1 GB outgoing per month, while Playit.gg does not have a hard bandwidth cap, though fair use policies apply.  
- **Protocol support:** Playit.gg supports UDP, which allows running Bedrock or Geyser servers.  
- **Pricing:** Playit.gg has a very generous free plan and a paid plan at $3 per month or $30 per year.

Neither tool modifies your server; they only provide a way to access it from outside your local network.
