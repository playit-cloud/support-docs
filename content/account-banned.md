Playit bans accounts that violate its Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy. These policies can be found here: {{< link "prohibited-uses" >}}.

The most common reason for an account ban is hosting C2C or malware-related servers such as Quasar or Xworm through Playit. These bans are applied immediately because such activity severely damages Playit's IP reputation and negatively impacts other Playit users.

# How do I know if i'm banned?

If you believe your account has been banned, log in to your Playit account. If you see a banner like the one below at the top of the page, your account is banned.

You will also encounter an error when attempting to run the `playit startup` command.

## Appealing a ban

If you believe your account was banned incorrectly, you can appeal by replying to the ban notification email you received or by contacting Playit support directly at support@playit.gg.
