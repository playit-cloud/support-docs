## CSS Transitions

**DO NOT add CSS transitions to this project.**

This includes:
- `transition` property in CSS
- `transition-*` Tailwind classes (`transition-all`, `transition-colors`, `transition-opacity`, etc.)
- Any animation timing or easing functions for state changes

Hover states and other interactive effects should apply immediately without animation.
