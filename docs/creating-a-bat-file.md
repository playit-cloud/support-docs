# Step 2. Set the file name to end with .bat

With the new file created, enter the name `run.bat`. You should get a warning confirming you want to change the name extension, press yes.

# Fixing Problems

## Make sure the file type is correct

Make sure the file type is a `Windows Batch File` file.

If the file type is `Text Document` you'll need to enable viewing file extensions and rename the file.

## Turn the .txt file into a .bat file
To do this, click the `View` tab on the top of your file explorer.

Then make sure `File name extensions` is checked.
